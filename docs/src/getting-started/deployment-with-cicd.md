# Deployment with CI/CD

The deployment process is different for [development](#development), [staging](#staging), and [production](#production) environments.
- **Development**: Best for short-term deployments to simulate a production environment as closely as possible. Useful for deploying feature branches before merging into `master`.
- **Staging**: The last "testing" environment to catch bugs before reaching production. Reserved for the latest commit on `master`.
- **Production**: User facing website! Changes being pushed to production should be thoroughly tested on a developer's local machine and in development and staging environments.

## Development

1. Go to the [actions page](https://github.com/asuc-octo/berkeleytime/actions).

3. Navigate to the "Run workflow" dropdown on the right. Select your branch and input a time to live in hours. Please keep this value a reasonable number.

4. Once the action starts running, click into the action and watch the status of each step. If the deployment fails, the action will fail as well.

5. After the action succeeds, go to `www.abcdefg.dev.stanfurdtime.com`, where `abcdefg` is the first 7 characters of the latest commit's hash. This is also shown on the summary tab of an action workflow. A hyperlink to the deployment is also available near the bottom of the Summary page of the workflow run.

## Staging

The staging CI/CD pipeline is automatically run on every push to `master` (currently `gql`). The staging website can be viewed at `staging.stanfurdtime.com`.

## Production

The production CI/CD pipeline is manually run with a process similar to the development pipeline. However, the production pipeline can only be run on `master` and `gql`.
