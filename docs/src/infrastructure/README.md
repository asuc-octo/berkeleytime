# Infrastructure

Welcome to the infrastructure section.

## What is Infrastructure?

![application-infrastructure-layers](./app-infra-layer.svg)

Infrastructure relates to the services, tools, and abstractions that the application layer is deployed on top of.

While common application-layer services, such as the backend and frontend services, relate to Berkeleytime application-specific tasks, the infrastructure-layer services relate to more generalized software development tasks, such as service deployment, system design, and developer experience.

In addition, we tend to use open-source services and tools to solve infrastructure-layer tasks instead of creating in-house tools. The motivation behind this philosophy is to not reinvent the wheelâ€”there is little open-source software like Berkeleytime, but there are many databases, caches, reverse proxies, etc. that we can use.
