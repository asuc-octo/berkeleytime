# Architecture

Berkeleytime uses a microservices architecture, like many larger projects and products. A microservice architecture provides many benefits in scaling, fault-tolerance, and flexibility that a monolith architecture lacks. With these advantages comes with disadvantages, the largest being the additional complexity.

Here is a diagram describing a simplified version of the system architecture. (There are black arrows that are difficult to see in a dark theme.)
