  {
    question: 'Where does Berkeleytime get its data? Is it accurate?',
    answer: <p>We source all our historic course and enrollment data directly from Berkeley <a href="https://sis.berkeley.edu/">Student Information System</a>&apos;s Course and Class APIs. We source grade data from <a className="link" href="https://calanswers.berkeley.edu/">CalAnswers</a>. Let us know if anything seems off!</p>,

  },
  {
    question: 'When are grades/classes/enrollment data released?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        All of our data is made available to our users as soon as it is published by the school. For class information,
        this typically occurs 2 weeks before the start of Phase I. Grades data is typically published 2-3 months after the end of
        the semester. Enrollment data is refreshed continuously as students enroll and drop classes throughout the semester.
      </p>
