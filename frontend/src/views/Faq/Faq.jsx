  {
    question: 'Where does Berkeleytime get its data? Is it accurate?',
    answer: <p>We source all our historic course and enrollment data directly from Berkeley
      <a href="https://sis.berkeley.edu/">Student Information System</a>&apos;s Course and Class APIs. We source grade
      data from <a className="link" href="https://calanswers.berkeley.edu/">CalAnswers</a>. Let us know if anything seems off!</p>,
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does an enrollment chart show more than 100% students enrolled?',
    answer: <p>This is not a bug; the percent enrolled graph compares the number of students enrolled at a given time to the current
      enrollment cap of the class. Throughout the semester, professors or department admins may choose to decrease the class
      size below the number of students enrolled to limit further enrollment. Hence, some classes may show over 100%
      enrollment at certain points in the enrollment timeline. </p>,
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I contact the Berkeleytime team?',
    answer: <p>Any questions or concerns that you have can be directed to <a href="mailto: octo.berkeley@asuc.org">octo.berkeley@asuc.org</a>.</p>,
  },
  {
    question: 'When are grades/classes/enrollment data released?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        All of our data is made available to our users as soon as it is published by the school. For class information,
        this typically occurs 2 weeks before the start of Phase I. Grades data is typically published 2-3 months after the end of
        the semester. Enrollment data is refreshed continuously as students enroll and drop classes throughout the semester.
      </p>
    ),
