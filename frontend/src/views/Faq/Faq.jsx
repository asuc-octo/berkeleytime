Faq.questions = [
  {
    question: 'Where does Berkeleytime get its data? Is it accurate?',
    answer: <p>We source all our historic course and enrollment data directly from Berkeley <a className="link" href="https://sis.berkeley.edu/">
      Student Information System</a>'s Course and Class APIs. We source grade data
      from <a className="link" href="https://calanswers.berkeley.edu/">CalAnswers</a>. Let us know if anything seems off!</p>
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I contact the Berkeleytime team?',
    answer: <p>Any questions or concerns that you have can be directed to <a className="link" href="mailto: octo.berkeley@asuc.org">

  },
  {
    question: 'When are grades/classes/enrollment data released?',
    answer: <p>All of our data is made available to our users as soon as it is published by the school. For class information,
      this typically occurs 2 weeks before the start of Phase I. Grades data is typically published 2-3 months after the end of
      the semester. Enrollment data is refreshed continuously as students enroll and drop classes throughout the semester.</p>
  },
  {
    question: 'Is anyone actively working on Berkeleytime?',
    answer: <p>Yes, we're a student-run organization here on campus under the <a className="link" href="https://octo.asuc.org//">
      ASUC Office of the CTO</a>. Our team meets weekly to maintain and improve the site. You can learn more about
      us <Link to="/about" className="link">here</Link>!</p>
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I apply to join the team?',
    answer: <p>We typically recruit engineers and designers at the start of every fall semester; keep an eye out on our website and our <a className="link" href = "https://www.facebook.com/berkeleytime/">Facebook page</a> for updates.</p>
  },
  {
    question: 'Berkeleytime is down/I found a bug!',
    answer: <p>Remain calm! If you find an issue with the site or data, please let us know by submitting
      a <Link to="/bugs" className="link">bug report</Link>, and one of our on-call engineers will try to get to it as soon as possible.</p>
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I access your API for a project Iâ€™m working on?',
    answer: <p>Yes! Our backend API is officially open and available for anyone to use. You can read the
      documentation <a className="link" href="/apidocs">here</a>.</p>
  },
