### How are we affiliated with the STF?

Since 2015, Berkeleytime has largely been funded by the Student Tech Fund (STF). Although our entire team is composed of unpaid volunteers ðŸ™‹, we have relied on our grant to fund web hosting, user research, and a reliable backend uptime. Instead of begging you for money Ã  la Wikipedia style ðŸ’¸, we've focused on launching a number of new features like Berkeleytime on mobile, user profiles, and an improved search experience.

Aside from funding Berkeleytime, the STF has funded a number of [widely recognized services and projects](https://techfund.berkeley.edu/impact/funded-projects/grantee-project-profiles) such as access to ZoomPro, the Adobe Suite, and the Student Technology Equity Program (STEP).

We just wanted to add this note and show our appreciation for all of the work the STF has done in the background. You can learn more about the renewal of the fund [here](https://techfund.berkeley.edu/renewal-ballot).
