# Berkeleytime

## Background

A course discovery and planning tool which combines all of UC Berkeley's academic information in one place. We intend to make it a more accurate and powerful tool than anything students currently use.

Berkeleytime was created by [Yuxin Zhu](http://yuxinzhu.com/) and [Noah Gilmore](https://noahgilmore.com) and is maintained by [the ASUC Office of the CTO](https://octo.asuc.org/).

# Getting started

Much of the current development is on [the gql branch](https://github.com/asuc-octo/berkeleytime/tree/gql).
