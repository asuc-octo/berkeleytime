   * So that we can test many re-runs without pissing off SIS (rate limits),
   * go through all of the course XML pages at one time, stream contents to GCP
   * while it comes in so that program doesn't risk running out of RAM,
   * while also not taking up disk space
   * planned implementation so far:
   * - install gcloud-sdk
   * - configure keys to use GCS
   * - open low-level socket or stream to GCS path
   * - increment page-size until API returns an error or end is reached
   * - close the stream in GCS, thereby saving the XML file
